# UserActionPrediction_And_Clustering

Predict the actions based on the user behavior for the given URL

* The accompanying data set consists of user sessions in an anonymized web app. In particular, it contains actions that these users take on a given URL at a given date and time.

Below are the tasks covered in the notebook:

* Exploration of the data and extensive observations
* Creating user segments (clusters) based on their activity
  * What kind of cleaning is needed to be done?
  * What features can be created for this segmentation?
 
* Visualize the clusters
* Analyze URL structure
* Patterns in sessions/paths
* Some predictive modeling, if possible
